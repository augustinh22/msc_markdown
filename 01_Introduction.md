# Introduction

## Context/Background

- big data and big earth data


- free and open-access EO data
- trends towards utilisation to support international initiatives (SDGs)
- indicators of humanitarian crisis or generation of spatially-explicit evidence of humanitarian crisis

## Definition of Terms

- big data
- big Earth data
- data cube
- Top of Atmosphere vs. BOA vs. SURF calibration
- ESA Level 1C - Level 2A
- semantic enrichment
- humanitarian "crisis"
- indicator
- livelihood

## General Objectives

knowledge of existing indicators that utilise EO-data

develop and apply a highly automated, scalable workflow

familiarity with data cube technologies

semi-automated indicator extraction

## Use-Case Selection

Northern Syria

Justification for choice (Syrian conflict, weather/climate, Sentinel-2 data projection + overlap of swaths)

After-the-fact Turkish attack on/invasion of Afrin, Syria

Mention previous study with Landsat data

## Research Questions

The following body of work aims towards answering the following:

What indicators exist in the realm of humanitarian-related monitoring or detection?

Are semi-concepts sufficient for semi-automated monitoring in a humanitarian domain, where time is of the essence and sample-based algorithms applicability to various climates/ geographic locations might be limited?
