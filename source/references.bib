  abstract = {Today, 2D-GIS applications are standard tools in administration and management. As with all state-of-the-art systems certain environmental parameters were found to be difficult to perceive and convey, such that a novel 3D-presentation of the environment was developed to be more intuitive. The cost-effective graphics performance of current computers enables the move towards 3D-GIS and in turn, more detailed views of the environment. While current forestry-2D-GISs provide information on areas or collection of trees, the next generation of forestry-3D-GISs will store and make information available at level of an individual tree. In this paper we introduce an approach to bring vision technology into the forest. We present a volumetric algorithm based on the well-known watershed algorithm and use it to detect trees in laser-scanner point-clouds and four-channel aerial views. Based on this data, maps and virtual environments, ‘virtual forests’ are generated which can be used in a 3D-GIS for forest management, disaster management, forest machine navigation and other purposes.},

No such cases are readily apparent for the current generation of geobrowsers, though the text of the 1998 Gore speech refers to several. An analysis of the use cases of geographic information systems (GIS) reveals similarities with the functionality of geobrowsers, inviting the view that the two forms of geographic information technology will eventually converge. However, experience suggests that users are finding very different ways of exploiting geobrowsers, and two examples are discussed in detail. These uses can be interpreted within a broad framework of spatial concepts, and the paper concludes that this framework provides a better guide to the future of geobrowsers and Digital Earth than current GIS technology.},

The - mostly 3D - output of software that calculates the specific phenomenon (e.g. air or noise pollution) is processed and visualised in 2D and combined with 2D topographical and other data, such as population distribution, to quantify the effects. The research described in the paper aimed at improving visualisation and quantification of impact of continuous spatial phenomena on the environment by applying a 3D approach. Noise is taken as example. Based on the specific demand, an approach is presented to generate a 3D noise map as basis for noise impact studies. The proposed concept is proofed by applying it to a sample noise impact study. From experiences with the sample it can be concluded that the 3D noise map offers insight into the 3D noise situation where 2D noise maps have limitations. In addition more accurate assessment of noise impact is possible in particular when different floors of a building close to the noise source and/or behind noise barriers are considered, which is specifically relevant in urban areas. The proposed methodology can be applied to other continuous spatial phenomena so that it meets the more general problem of how to represent 3D aspects of environmental impact studies.},

Delaunay triangulation is a good way to formalize nice shape, and if higher-order Delaunay triangulations are used, drainage reality can be achieved. Two heuristics are presented, one for reducing the number of local minima and one for reducing the number of valley edges and components. The empirical results show how well they perform on real-world data; on average we see a 16\% improvement over known algorithms.},

An overview of applications in geomorphology and related fields using different LiDAR data products (e.g. Digital Terrain Model and 3D point cloud) is given, indicating a great variety of fields of applications and data analysis approaches. These applications range from visual interpretation of LiDAR derivatives (e.g. shaded relief map) to semi-automatic geomorphological mapping and fully automatic object detection (e.g. surface discontinuities). A quantitative analysis of the temporal trend of peer-reviewed journal publications confirms the increased consideration of airborne LiDAR data for mapping, modeling and exploiting Earth surface processes and landforms.

We show that many of these concepts can be derived from a single foundation that we term the atomic form of geographic information. The familiar concepts of continuous fields and discrete objects can be derived under suitable rules applied to the properties and values of the atomic form. Fields and objects are further integrated through the concept of phase space, and in the form of field objects. A second atomic concept is introduced, termed the geo‐dipole, and shown to provide a foundation for object fields, metamaps, and the association classes of object‐oriented data modelling. Geographic dynamics are synthesized in a three‐dimensional space defined by static or dynamic object shape, the possibility of movement, and the possibility of dynamic internal structure. The atomic form also provides a tentative argument that discrete objects and continuous fields are the only possible bases for geographic representation.},

  abstract = {It is an unequivocal fact that to date the automatic or semi-automatic transformation of huge amounts of multisource multi-resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery into useful information (such as biophysical variables, categorical maps, etc.) still remains far more problematic than might be reasonably expected. To invert this trend, a novel two-stage stratified hierarchical hybrid remote sensing image understanding system (RS-IUS) was presented in recent literature to encompass the four levels of analysis of an information processing device, namely, computational theory (system architecture), knowledge/information representation, algorithm design and implementation. The proposed original RS-IUS architecture comprises: (i) a first-stage pixel-based application-independent top-down (deductive, physical model-driven, prior knowledge-based) preliminary classifier and (ii) a second-stage battery of stratified hierarchical context-sensitive application-dependent modules for class-specific feature extraction and classification. The proposed implementation of the prior knowledge-based preliminary classification first stage of a two-stage stratified hierarchical hybrid RS-IUS consists of the original Satellite Image Automatic Mapper™ (SIAM™ , University of Maryland Invention Disclosure No. IS-2010-103, patent pending, © Andrea Baraldi \& University of Maryland). SIAM™ is an operational automatic (turnkey, good-to-go, press-and-go) software button (executable) for unsupervised near real-time per-pixel multi-source multiresolution application-independent spectral rule-based decision-tree classification of spaceborne multi-spectral imagery. The goal of this patent review is to highlight the several degrees of novelty and operational advantages of the proposed two-stage hybrid RS-IUS employing SIAM™ as its preliminary classification first stage in comparison with alternative approaches, such as two-stage object-based RS-IUSs which, in spite of their lack of consensus and research, have recently gained widespread popularity in both scientific and commercial RS image applications.},

Finally, geographical information science is defined as the set of basic research issues arising from these technologies. Three motivations are presented for research in this area: scientific, technological, and societal. Within the project, geographical information science is structured by a three-part framework that includes cognitive, computational, and societal issues. The paper ends with an introduction to these three parts, which define the infrastructure of the project and are discussed at length by the subsequent three papers.},

Starting from a 2D City map which contains relevant features by their outline, 3D City maps are created by adding height to the outlines of buildings and other objects. Further enhancements are made by adding roof representations and facade textures. These textures can either be an exact representation of the facade or be composed of predefined elements from a library which leads to significant data size reductions. In the production process, Mobile Mapping a technology developed at Tele Atlas plays an important role. It serves to collect building heights and facade textures and components. To date this has resulted in the availability of 3D City maps of 12 cities with important extension planned for 2008. The paper ends by stating that whereas the original reason to develop 3D maps stems from a desire to improve the user interface of navigation and other Intelligent Transport applications, it is likely that 3D models will have growing significance in future also for in-car safety systems.},

  abstract = {NeoGeography has been defined as a blurring of the distinctions between producer, communicator and consumer of geographic information. The relationship between professional and amateur varies across disciplines. The subject matter of geography is familiar to everyone, and the acquisition and compilation of geographic data have become vastly easier as technology has advanced. The authority of traditional mapping agencies can be attributed to their specifications, production mechanisms and programs for quality control. Very different mechanisms work to ensure the quality of data volunteered by amateurs. Academic geographers are concerned with the extraction of knowledge from geographic data using a combination of analytic tools and accumulated theory. The definition of NeoGeography implies a misunderstanding of this role of the professional, but English lacks a basis for a better term.},

  abstract = {We consider, in this paper, the problem of reconstructing the surface from contour lines of a topographic map. We reconstruct the surface by approximating the elevations, as specified by the contour lines, by tensor-product cubic B-splines using the least squared-error criterion. The resulting surface is both accurate and smooth and is free from the terracing artifacts that occur when thin-plate splines are used to reconstruct the surface. The approximating surface, S(x,y), is a linear combination of tensorproduct cubic B-splines. We denote the second-order partial derivatives of S by S xx , S xy and S yy . Let h k be the elevations at the points (x k ,y k ) on the contours. S is found by minimising the sum of the squared-errors \{S(x k ,y k )?h k \}2 and the quantity ∫∫ S xx 2 x,y) + 2s xy 2 (x,y)+S yy 2 (x,y)dydx the latter weighted by a constant λ. Thus, the coefficients of a small number of tensor-product cubic B-splines define the reconstructed surface. Also, since tensor-product cubic B-splines are non-zero only for four knot-intervals in the x-direction and y-direction, the elevation at any point can be found in constant time and a grid DEM can be generated from the coefficients of the B-splines in time linear in the size of the grid.},

Early digital technology did little to broaden the constraints, and led cartography, map analysis and spatial analysis in different directions. More recent hardware and the results of intensive research have produced a digital cartography which can successfully emulate its analogue parent. However, its true potential lies in less conventional methods of analysis and display and in the degree to which it can escape its traditional constraints.},

On the basis of the proposition of GIS as media, we were able to link GIScience with theories in media studies such as Marshall McLuhan's law of the media, which considers modern media as modifiable perceptive extensions of human thought (Sui and Goodchild 2003). Remarkable conceptual and technological advances in GIS have been made during the past 10 years. The goal of this review is to provide an update on the ‘GIS as media’ argument we made 10 years ago and to discuss the new challenges for GIScience posed by the growing convergence of GIS and social media.},

Other than costly destructive harvest methods, no technique exists to rapidly and accurately measure above-ground perennial tissue for woody plants such as Vitis vinifera (common grape vine). Data collected from grapevine trunks and cordons were used to study the accuracy of wood volume derived from laser scanning as compared with volume derived from analog measurements. A set of 10 laser scan datasets were collected for each of 36 vines from which volume was calculated using combinations of two, three, four, six and 10 scans. Likewise, analog volume measurements were made by submerging the vine trunks and cordons in water and capturing the displaced water. A regression analysis examined the relationship between digital and non-digital techniques among the 36 vines and found that the standard error drops rapidly as additional scans are added to the volume calculation process and stabilizes at the four-view geometry with an average Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient of 0.93. Estimates of digital volumes are systematically greater than those of analog volumes and can be explained by the manner in which each technique interacts with the vine tissue. This laser scanning technique yields a highly linear relationship between vine volume and tissue mass revealing a new, rapid and non-destructive method to remotely measure standing biomass. This application shows promise for use in other ecosystems such as orchards and forests.},

The implementation of the new Moran's indexes is illustrated through artificial and real examples. Analyses of the influencing factors on TDGSTI are performed. A statistical test of TDGSTI is taken. The Moran's scatter plot, which discloses the spatio-temporal cluster pattern's characteristics and pattern's change, is extended. TDGSTI is found to reveal the autocorrelation level of spatio-temporal objects. For a positive TDGSTI, the higher the TDGSTI, the higher the autocorrelation level, and vice versa. TDGSTI is closely related to time-scale s, time-lag h and spatio-temporal weight matrix. For s ≫ h , TDGSTI is significant, while for s ∼ h and s \&lt; h , TDGSTI is insignificant. TDGSTI has clear potential to test the spatio-temporal autocorrelation's degree for spatio-temporal nonstationary series in other research fields.},

Using LiDAR technology with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), high-resolution data on the SD distribution were acquired during the 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 snow seasons, which were 2 years having very contrasting climatic and snow accumulation conditions. Average SD evolution in open and canopy areas was characterized. Principal component analysis was applied to identify days having similar spatial patterns of SD distribution. There was a clear contrast in the temporal variability of the snowpack in different areas of the forest stand, corresponding generally to beneath the canopy, and in open sites. The canopy and openings showed markedly different accumulation and melting, with higher snow accumulation found in openings. Differences ranged from 14 to 80\% reduction (average 49\%) in the SD beneath the canopy relative to open sites. The difference in SD between open and canopy areas increased throughout the snow season. The surveyed days were classified in terms of SD distribution, and included days associated with: high SD, low SD, intense melting conditions and periods when the SD distribution was driven by wind conditions. The SD increased with distance from the trunks to a distance of 3.5–4.5 m, coinciding with the average size of the crown of individual trees.},

  abstract = {The convergence of newly interactive Web-based technologies with growing practices of user-generated content disseminated on the Internet is generating a remarkable new form of geographic information. Citizens are using handheld devices to collect geographic information and contribute it to crowd-sourced data sets, using Web-based mapping interfaces to mark and annotate geographic features, or adding geographic location to photographs, text, and other media shared online. These phenomena, which generate what we refer to collectively as volunteered geographic information (VGI), represent a paradigmatic shift in how geographic information is created and shared and by whom, as well as its content and characteristics. This article, which draws on our recently completed inventory of VGI initiatives, is intended to frame the crucial dimensions of VGI for geography and geographers, with an eye toward identifying its potential in our field, as well as the most pressing research needed to realize this potential. Drawing on our ongoing research, we examine the content and characteristics of VGI, the technical and social processes through which it is produced, appropriate methods for synthesizing and using these data in research, and emerging social and political concerns related to this new form of information.},

  abstract = {Online social networking and information sharing services have generated large volumes of spatio-temporal footprints, which are potentially a valuable source of knowledge about the physical environment and social phenomena. However, it is critical to take into consideration the uneven distribution of the data generated in social media in order to understand the nature of such data and to use them appropriately. The distribution of footprints and the characteristics of contributors indicate the quantity, quality, and type of the data. Using georeferenced tweets and photos collected from Twitter and Flickr, this research presents the spatial and temporal patterns of such crowd-sourced geographic data in the contiguous United States and explores the socioeconomic characteristics of geographic data creators by investigating the relationships between tweet and photo densities and the characteristics of local people using California as a case study. Correlations between dependent and independent variables in partial least squares regression suggest that well-educated people in the occupations of management, business, science, and arts are more likely to be involved in the generation of georeferenced tweets and photos. Further research is required to explain why some people tend to produce and spread information over the Internet using social media from the perspectives of psychology and sociology. This study would be informative to sociologists who study the behaviors of social media users, geographers who are interested in the spatial and temporal distribution of social media users, marketing agencies who intend to understand the influence of social media, and other scientists who use social media data in their research.},

Multidimensional arrays naturally match the structure of spatio-temporal satellite data and can provide a clean modeling process for complex spatio-temporal analysis over large datasets. Our study case illustrates the detection of breakpoints in MODIS imagery time series for land cover change in the Brazilian Amazon using the BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend) change detection framework. BFAST includes an Empirical Fluctuation Process (EFP) to alarm the change and a change point time locating process. We extend the EFP to account for the spatial autocorrelation between spatial neighbors and assess the effects of spatial correlation when applying BFAST on satellite image time series. In addition, we evaluate how sensitive EFP is to the assumption that its time series residuals are temporally uncorrelated, by modeling it as an autoregressive process. We use arrays as a unified data structure for the modeling process, R to execute the analysis, and an array database management system to scale computation. Our results point to BFAST as a robust approach against mild temporal and spatial correlation, to the use of arrays to ease the modeling process of spatio-temporal change, and towards communicable and scalable analysis.},

Several fundamental research questions are raised and addressed while a set of CyberGIS challenges and opportunities are identified from scientific perspectives. The study reviews several key CyberGIS software tools that are used to elucidate a vision and roadmap for CyberGIS software research. The roadmap focuses on software integration and synthesis of cyberinfrastructure, GIS, and SAM by defining several key integration dimensions and strategies. CyberGIS, based on this holistic integration roadmap, exhibits the following key characteristics: high-performance and scalable, open and distributed, collaborative, service-oriented, user-centric, and community-driven. As a major result of the roadmap, two key CyberGIS modalities – gateway and toolkit – combined with a community-driven and participatory approach have laid a solid foundation to achieve scientific breakthroughs across many geospatial communities that would be otherwise impossible.},

  abstract = {A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \$$\backslash$nabla \^\{2\}\$G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \$$\backslash$nabla \^\{2\}\$ is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \$$\backslash$nabla \^\{2\}\$G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr \& Ullman 1979).},

Development of quick, easy and efficient methods to determine the fundamental parameters used to characterize canopy structure is thus an important need. In this research the use of ultrasonic and LIDAR sensors have been compared with the traditional manual and destructive canopy measurement procedure. For both methods the values of key parameters such as crop height, crop width, crop volume or leaf area have been compared. Obtained results indicate that an ultrasonic sensor is an appropriate tool to determine the average canopy characteristics, while a LIDAR sensor provides more accuracy and detailed information about the canopy. Good correlations have been obtained between crop volume (CVU) values measured with ultrasonic sensors and leaf area index, LAI (R2 = 0.51). A good correlation has also been obtained between the canopy volume measured with ultrasonic and LIDAR sensors (R2 = 0.52). Laser measurements of crop height (CHL) allow one to accurately predict the canopy volume. The proposed new technologies seems very appropriate as complementary tools to improve the efficiency of pesticide applications, although further improvements are still needed.},

Seven examples of distinct data types and scientific questions are examined, leading to the conclusion that a space–time geographic information system is unlikely to emerge in the near future. Instead, attention should focus on the systematic study of the issues involved in integration through the formal environment of a computational system.},

An attractive alternative for simulating a fluid flow is the Free-Lagrange Method (FLM). In this paper, I discuss the use of the FLM—based on the Voronoi diagram (VD)—for the modelling of fluid flow in three dimensions (e.g. the movement of underground water or of pollution plumes in the ocean). Such a technique requires the kinetic three-dimensional VD, which is a VD for which the points are allowed to move freely in space. I present a new algorithm for the movement of points in a three-dimensional VD, and show that it can be relatively easy to implement as it is the extension of a simple two-dimensional algorithm.},

While a solution is not reached, it is widely recognized that the need to integrate information is so pressing that it does not matter if detail is lost, as long as integration is achieved. This paper shows the potential for information retrieval at different levels of granularity inside the framework of information systems based on ontologies. Ontologies are theories that use a specific vocabulary to describe entities, classes, properties and functions related to a certain view of the world. The use of an ontology, translated into an active information system component, leads to ontology-driven information systems and, in the specific case of GIS, leads to what we call ontology-driven geographic information systems.},

This paper discusses a method to calculate land cover changes based on fuzzy settings. In this method, land cover is regarded as fuzzy spatial objects rather than crisp objects. The fuzzy land cover is derived based on a fuzzy classification. The degree of change is then calculated using fuzzy reasoning. In order to minimize any errors in image matching, fuzzy polygons are adopted in the reasoning. By incorporating spectral value differences, the errors in image classification can be reduced considerably. The land cover changes from 1989 to 1998 in a part of Sanya City of China are inferred as an example. The results show that this fuzzy method is able to identify the land cover changes more precisely than the crisp method. Furthermore, the transitional land cover changes can be revealed as a by‐product.},

  abstract = {The concept of vulnerability is pillared by multiple disciplinary theories underpinning either a technical or a social origin of the concept and resulting in a range of paradigms for either a qualitative or quantitative assessment of vulnerability. However, efforts to reduce susceptibility to hazards and to create disaster-resilient communities require intersections among these theories, since human activity cannot be seen independently from the environmental setting. Acknowledging different roots of disciplinary paradigms, issues determining structural, economic, institutional and social vulnerability are discussed with respect to mountain hazards in Austria. It is argued that structural vulnerability as originator results in considerable economic vulnerability, generated by the institutional settings of dealing with natural hazards and shaped by the overall societal framework. If vulnerability and its counterpart, resilience, is analysed and evaluated by using a comprehensive approach, a better understanding of the vulnerability-influencing parameters could be achieved, taking into account the interdependencies and interactions between the disciplinary foci. Thereby the overall aim of this paper is not to develop another integrative approach for vulnerability assessment, different approaches are rather applied by using a vulnerability-of-place criterion, and key issues of vulnerability are reconsidered aiming at a general illustration of the situation in a densely populated mountain region of Europe.},

River embankments for flood protection have been in use for centuries. Although they are artificial structures that actually do not belong to the natural elements of the land surface they are usually implicitly embedded in digital terrain data. Being elongated and elevated objects, they appear — depending on the used colour ramp for visualisation — as bright stripes on the surrounding background. For purposes of flood protection it might be useful to gain data about crest levels, especially if these information are not available from other sources. High resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTM) can be used as highly reliable sources for deriving dike heights. Using laser scanner technique a general height accuracy of about 10–15 cm can be achieved for elevation models. Thus, by analysing DTM data relevant geometrical information on dikes can be directly derived.},

Applications that require conflation of multiple DEMs are problematic, however, because of misregistration. We explore a spatial optimization technique to quantify the misregistration on the pixel level between NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data set and the USGS’s National Elevation Dataset (NED). The misregistration, estimated within blocks by horizontal offset and direction, is modelled spatially in terms of typical topographical parameters: slope, aspect and elevation. A Nelder–Mead algorithm was implemented to compute the local shift at two study sites in the San Gabriel Mountains (SGM) and Santa Monica Mountains (SMM) in Los Angeles County, California. The magnitude of misregistration is generally less than the distance between DEM postings, and varies by terrain type, being larger in steeper terrains; nevertheless, misregistration is systematic within these continuous terrains that have similar topographical features.},

  abstract = {The application of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) for precise modelling of land relief and quantitative estimation of spatial and temporal transformations can contribute to better understanding of catchment-forming processes. Experimental field measurements utilising the 3D laser scanning technology were carried out within the Scott River catchment located in the NW part of the Wedel Jarlsberg Land (Spitsbergen). The measurements concerned the glacier-free part of the Scott River valley floor with a length of 3.5 km and width from 0.3 to 1.5 km and were conducted with a state-of-the-art medium-range stationary laser scanner, a Leica Scan Station C10. A complex set of measurements of the valley floor were carried out from 86 measurement sites interrelated by the application of 82 common ‘target points’. During scanning, from 5 to 19 million measurements were performed at each of the sites, and a point-cloud constituting a ‘model space’ was obtained. By merging individual ‘model spaces’, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) of the Scott River valley was obtained, with a co-registration error not exceeding ± 9 mm. The accuracy of the model permitted precise measurements of dimensions of landforms of varied scales on the main valley floor and slopes and in selected sub-catchments. The analyses verified the efficiency of the measurement system in Polar meteorological conditions of Spitsbergen in mid-summer.},

WGFS provides direct access through Web services to 3D geological models. WGFS is based on a three-tier architecture: a client (Gocad), an application server (Apache Tomcat and Deegree) and a DBMS (MySQL). This architecture takes advantage of standard-compliant spatial applications such as WFS and GML standards stemming from OGC and spatial schema from ISO TC/211-Geographic Information. Before introducing the architecture and motivations of some geoinformatics choices, we will remind some important issues that have to be taken into account when such development is planned.},

Our study compares GWR as a predictor to (a) its global counterpart of multiple linear regression (MLR); (b) traditional geostatistical models such as ordinary kriging (OK) and universal kriging (UK), with MLR as a mean component; and (c) hybrids, where kriging models are specified with GWR as a mean component. For this purpose, we test the performance of each model on data simulated with differing levels of spatial heterogeneity (with respect to data relationships in the mean process) and spatial autocorrelation (in the residual process). Our results demonstrate that kriging (in a UK form) should be the preferred predictor, reflecting its optimal statistical properties. However the GWR-kriging hybrids perform with merit and, as such, a predictor of this form may provide a worthy alternative to UK for particular (non-stationary relationship) situations when UK models cannot be reliably calibrated. GWR predictors tend to perform more poorly than their more complex GWR-kriging counterparts, but both GWR-based models are useful in that they provide extra information on the spatial processes generating the data that are being predicted.},

Since the framework is based on ordering geometry and does not rely on numerical concepts, it can be applied to qualitative spatial reasoning. The characterization describes vague regions and gradual transitions between two vague regions. This approach takes into account that the region of all points that definitely belong to an object is also vague, called higher-order vagueness. Higher-order vagueness is usually neglected by theories modeling spatial vagueness. The approach distinguishes firstand second-order vague regions and characterizes the gradual transitions of second-order vague regions. These gradual transitions allow transitions within transitions. In general, it is not possible to reduce higher-order vagueness to first-order vagueness. Using a spatial ordering structure the article shows when second-order vagueness is useful and examines the relationship between first- and second-order vagueness. An example shows how second-order vagueness can be used to represent geographic objects.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) is an active instrument widely used for physical surface acquisition and data modeling. TLS provides both the geometry and the intensity information of scanned objects depending on their physical and chemical properties. The intensity data can be used to discriminate different materials, since intensity is proportional, among other parameters, to the reflectance of the target at the specific wavelength of the laser beam. This article focuses on the TLS-based recognition of rocks in simple sedimentary successions mainly constituted by limestones and marls. In particular, a series of experiments with an Optech ILRIS 3D TLS was carried out to verify the feasibility of this application, as well as to solve problems in data acquisition protocol and data processing. Results indicate that a TLS intensity-based discrimination can provide reliable information about the clay content of rocks in clean outcrop conditions if the geometrical aspects of the acquisition (i.e.~distance) are taken into account. Reflectance values of limestones, marls and clays show, both in controlled conditions and in the field, clear differences due to the interaction of the laser beam (having a 1535 nm wavelength) with H2O-bearing minerals and materials. Information about lithology can be therefore obtained also from real outcrops, at least if simple alternation of limestones and marls are considered. Comparison between reflectance values derived from TLS acquisition of an outcrop and the clay abundance curves obtained by gas chromatography on rock samples taken from the same stratigraphic section shows that reflectance is linked by an inverse linear relationship (correlation coefficient r = − 0.85 ) to the abundance of clay minerals in the rocks. Reflectance series obtained from TLS data are proposed as a tool to evaluate the variation of clay content along a stratigraphic section. The possibility of linking reflectance values to lithological parameters (i.e.~clay content) could provide a tool for lithological mapping of outcrops, with possible applications in various fields, ranging from petroleum geology to environmental engineering, stratigraphy and sedimentology.},

While the theoretical range of I extends from roughly −1 to 1 for a raster map, in practice possible I values are much more restricted. The nature of the restriction is due to the rigid cell framework, which defines contiguity, as well as the relative proportions of ones to zeros in the binary raster. This paper presents experimental findings demonstrating the practical limits of Moran’s I under a variety of different proportions and contiguity measures. Results for negatively autocorrelated surfaces are particularly noteworthy; unequal proportions of ones and zeros can result in minimal I values considerably larger than −1, and in many cases considerably larger than 0. Implications for the use of I on raster maps are considered, as is the potential relevance of negative spatial autocorrelation and its measurement.},

To outperform the degree of automation, accuracy, efficiency, robustness, scalability and timeliness of existing GEOBIA/GEOOIA systems in compliance with the Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation (QA4EO) guidelines, this methodological work is split into two parts. The present first paper provides a multi-disciplinary Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the GEOBIA/GEOOIA approaches that augments similar analyses proposed in recent years. In line with constraints stemming from human vision, this SWOT analysis promotes a shift of learning paradigm in the pre-attentive vision first stage of a remote sensing (RS) image understanding system (RS-IUS), from sub-symbolic statistical model-based (inductive) image segmentation to symbolic physical model-based (deductive) image preliminary classification. Hence, a symbolic deductive pre-attentive vision first stage accomplishes image sub-symbolic segmentation and image symbolic pre-classification simultaneously. In the second part of this work a novel hybrid (combined deductive and inductive) RS-IUS architecture featuring a symbolic deductive pre-attentive vision first stage is proposed and discussed in terms of: (a) computational theory (system design); (b) information/knowledge representation; (c) algorithm design; and (d) implementation. As proof-of-concept of symbolic physical model-based pre-attentive vision first stage, the spectral knowledge-based, operational, near real-time Satellite Image Automatic Mapper™ (SIAM™) is selected from existing literature. To the best of these authors’ knowledge, this is the first time a symbolic syntactic inference system, like SIAM™, is made available to the RS community for operational use in a RS-IUS pre-attentive vision first stage, to accomplish multi-scale image segmentation and multi-granularity image pre-classification simultaneously, automatically and in near real-time.},

  shorttitle = {Accurate {{3D}} Comparison of Complex Topography with Terrestrial Laser Scanner},
  abstract = {Surveying techniques such as terrestrial laser scanner have recently been used to measure surface changes via 3D point cloud (PC) comparison. Two types of approaches have been pursued: 3D tracking of homologous parts of the surface to compute a displacement field, and distance calculation between two point clouds when homologous parts cannot be defined. This study deals with the second approach, typical of natural surfaces altered by erosion, sedimentation or vegetation between surveys. Current comparison methods are based on a closest point distance or require at least one of the PC to be meshed with severe limitations when surfaces present roughness elements at all scales. To solve these issues, we introduce a new algorithm performing a direct comparison of point clouds in 3D. The method has two steps: (1) surface normal estimation and orientation in 3D at a scale consistent with the local surface roughness; (2) measurement of the mean surface change along the normal direction with explicit calculation of a local confidence interval. Comparison with existing methods demonstrates the higher accuracy of our approach, as well as an easier workflow due to the absence of surface meshing or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generation. Application of the method in a rapidly eroding, meandering bedrock river (Rangitikei River canyon) illustrates its ability to handle 3D differences in complex situations (flat and vertical surfaces on the same scene), to reduce uncertainty related to point cloud roughness by local averaging and to generate 3D maps of uncertainty levels. We also demonstrate that for high precision survey scanners, the total error budget on change detection is dominated by the point clouds registration error and the surface roughness. Combined with mm-range local georeferencing of the point clouds, levels of detection down to 6 mm (defined at 95\% confidence) can be routinely attained in situ over ranges of 50 m. We provide evidence for the self-affine behaviour of different surfaces. We show how this impacts the calculation of normal vectors and demonstrate the scaling behaviour of the level of change detection. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available open source software package. It operates in complex 3D cases and can also be used as a simpler and more robust alternative to DEM differencing for the 2D cases.},

  abstract = {During the past four decades (1960–2000), the United States experienced major transformations in population size, development patterns, economic conditions, and social characteristics. These social, economic, and built-environment changes altered the American hazardscape in profound ways, with more people living in high-hazard areas than ever before. To improve emergency management, it is important to recognize the variability in the vulnerable populations exposed to hazards and to develop place-based emergency plans accordingly. The concept of social vulnerability identifies sensitive populations that may be less likely to respond to, cope with, and recover from a natural disaster. Social vulnerability is complex and dynamic, changing over space and through time. This paper presents empirical evidence on the spatial and temporal patterns in social vulnerability in the United States from 1960 to the present. Using counties as our study unit, we found that those components that consistently increased social vulnerability for all time periods were density (urban), race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The spatial patterning of social vulnerability, although initially concentrated in certain geographic regions, has become more dispersed over time. The national trend shows a steady reduction in social vulnerability, but there is considerable regional variability, with many counties increasing in social vulnerability during the past five decades.},

  abstract = {An important infrastructure policy issue for rapidly growing cities in developing countries is how to raise fiscal revenues to finance basic services in a fair and efficient manner. This requires estimates of the potential benefits or positive welfare effects that may follow from improved infrastructure. In this paper, we take advantage of a unique geo-referenced household survey to carry out a hedonic analysis of housing values that explicitly accounts for spatial spillovers. We use this to derive an estimate of the value of improved access to water in the Indian city of Bangalore. The findings suggest that by limiting the focus to individual or private benefits only, we may underestimate the overall social welfare from investing in service supply. We further demonstrate how spatially explicit policy simulations based on these estimates provide insight into the total effects of targeted interventions. Appréciation de l'accès à l'eau—Une méthode hédonique spatiale appliquée à la ville de Bangalore, en Inde Rèsumè Un important problème de politique en matière d'infrastructure qui se pose pour les villes à expansion rapide de pays en voie de développement est comment lever des recettes fiscales, de façon à la fois équitable et efficace, pour financer des services essentiels. Ces villes doivent, pour ceci, procéder à des évaluations des bénéfices potentiels ou des effets sociaux positifs que pourrait engendrer une meilleure infrastructure. Dans la présente communication, nous faisons usage des résultats d'une étude géoréférencée unique sur les ménages pour effectuer une analyse hédonique des valeurs des habitations, qui tienne compte de façon explicite des débordements spatiaux. Nous utilisons ensuite ces résultats pour dériver une estimation de la valeur d'un meilleur accès à l'eau dans la ville de Bangalore, en Inde. Les conclusions indiquent qu'en limitant notre recherche aux bénéfices individuels ou privés seulement, nous risquons de sous-estimer les avantages sociaux généraux des investissements dans la fourniture de services. Nous démontrons également comment des simulations de la politique, aux implications spatiales implicites sur la base de ces évaluations, permettent d'obtenir des connaissances sur les effets totaux des interventions ciblées. Valorando el acceso a agua—Un planteamiento hedónico espacial con una aplicación a Bangalore, India Extracto Una cuestión importante en cuanto a política de infraestructura para las ciudades de rápido crecimiento en países en vías de desarrollo es cómo incrementar los ingresos fiscales para financiar servicios básicos de forma justa y eficiente. Esto requiere estimaciones de los beneficios potenciales o de los efectos positivos para el bienestar social que podrían derivar de una mejor infraestructura. En este trabajo aprovechamos un exclusivo estudio georreferenciado sobre la vivienda para aplicar un análisis hedónico que tiene en cuenta explícitamente excedentes espaciales. Lo utilizamos para derivar una estimación del valor de un mejor acceso a agua en la ciudad india de Bangalore. Los descubrimientos sugieren que limitando el enfoque a los beneficios individuales o privados podríamos subestimar el bienestar social general procedente de invertir en el suministro de servicios. También demostramos cómo las simulaciones de políticas espacialmente explícitas basadas en estas estimaciones proporcionan una visión interna de los efectos totales de intervenciones dirigidas.},

  abstract = {Modeling 3D geo-information has often been based on either simple extensions of 2D geo-information modeling principles without considering the additional 3D aspects related to correctness of representations or on 3D CAD based solutions applied to geo-information. Our approach is based from the scratch on modeling 3D geo-information based on the mathematically well-defined Poincaré-TEN data structure. The feasibility of this approach still has to be verified in practice. In this paper, the first experiences of loading a reasonable sized data set, comprised of about 1,800 buildings represented by nearly 170,000 tetrahedrons (including the ‘air’ and ‘earth’), are discussed. Though the Poincaré-TEN data structure is feasible, the experience gained during the implementation raises new research topics: physical storage in one (tetrahedron only) or two tables (tetrahedron and node), effective clustering and indexing improvements, more compact representations without losing too much performance, etc.},

Current research combines other data resources on extracting building information or uses pre-defined building models to fit the roof structures. However we want to find an alternative solution to reconstruct the 3D buildings without any additional data sources and predefined roof styles. Therefore our challenge is to use the captured data only and covert them into CAD-type models containing walls, roof planes and terrain which can be rapidly displayed from any 3D viewpoint.},

The implementation of the new Moran's indexes is illustrated through artificial and real examples. Analyses of the influencing factors on TDGSTI are performed. A statistical test of TDGSTI is taken. The Moran's scatter plot, which discloses the spatio-temporal cluster pattern's characteristics and pattern's change, is extended. TDGSTI is found to reveal the autocorrelation level of spatio-temporal objects. For a positive TDGSTI, the higher the TDGSTI, the higher the autocorrelation level, and vice versa. TDGSTI is closely related to time-scale s, time-lag h and spatio-temporal weight matrix. For s ≫ h , TDGSTI is significant, while for s ∼ h and s \&lt; h , TDGSTI is insignificant. TDGSTI has clear potential to test the spatio-temporal autocorrelation's degree for spatio-temporal nonstationary series in other research fields.},

The Main Map was obtained using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) technology from a long-range Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) in six field surveys undertaken during the 2012 winter-spring period. This technique enabled the acquisition of information at a very high resolution concerning the spatial variability of snow cover, providing snow depth information for remote areas where data acquisition is complex and hazardous. We describe the methodological steps and the quality assessment applied in developing the maps. Comparison with manual measurements confirmed the reliability of the snow depth maps, including areas located at large distances from the scanner (800 m). This method provides a promising tool for future investigations of snow dynamics in mountainous environments. © 2014 © 2014 J. Revuelto.},

  abstract = {In Part I of this paper, an operational fully automated Landsat-like image spectral rule-based decision-tree classifier (LSRC), suitable for mapping radiometrically calibrated seven-band Landsat-4/-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-7 Enhanced TM+ (ETM+) spaceborne images [eventually synthesized from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imaging sensor] into a discrete and finite set of spectral categories, has been downscaled to properly deal with spaceborne multispectral imaging sensors whose spectral resolution overlaps with, but is inferior to Landsat's, namely: 1) Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-4/-5, Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS)-1C/-1D/-P6 Linear Imaging Self-Scanner (LISS)-III, and IRS-P6 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS); 2) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG); 3) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR); 4) GeoEye-1, IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, OrbView-3, TopSat, KOrean MultiPurpose SATellite (KOMPSAT)-2, FORMOsa SATellite (FORMOSAT)-2, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2), RapidEye, WorldView-2, PLEIADES-1/-2, and SPOT-6/-7; and 5) Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC), IRS-P6 LISS-IV, and SPOT-1/-2. LSRC, together with its five downscaled versions, identified, respectively, as the four-band SPOT-like SRC (SSRC), the four-band AVHRR-like SRC (AVSRC), the five-band AATSR-like SRC (AASRC), the four-band IKONOS-like SRC (ISRC), and the three-band DMC-like SRC (DSRC), form the so-called integrated SRC system of systems. In this paper, first, the classification accuracy and robustness to changes in the input data set of SSRC, AVSRC, AASRC, ISRC, and DSRC are assessed, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in comparison with LSRC- - 's. Next, ongoing and future SRC applications are presented and discussed. They encompass: 1) the implementation of operational two-stage stratified hierarchical Remote Sensing (RS) image understanding systems discussed in Part I of this paper; 2) the integration of near real-time satellite mapping services with Internet map servers; and 3) the development of a new approach to semantic querying of large-scale multisensor image databases. These experimental results and application examples prove that the integrated SRC system of systems is operational, namely, it is effective, near real-time, automatic, and robust to changes in the input data set. Therefore, SRC appears eligible for use in operational satellite-based measurement systems such as those envisaged by the ongoing international Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) Programme and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) system project.},

This paper employs geo-located social media data to identify ‘digital neighborhoods’ – those areas in the city where social media is used more often. Starting with geo-located Twitter and Foursquare data for the New York City region in 2014, we applied spatial clustering techniques to detect significant groupings or ‘neighborhoods’ where social media use is high or low. The results show that beyond the business districts, digital neighborhoods occur in communities undergoing shifting socio-demographics. Neighborhoods that are not digitally oriented tend to have higher proportion of minorities and lower incomes, highlighting a social–economic divide in how social media is used in the city. Understanding the differences in these neighborhoods can help city planners interested in generating economic development proposals, civic engagement strategies, and urban design ideas that target these areas.},

To outperform the Quality Indexes of Operativeness (OQIs) of existing GEOBIA/GEOOIA systems in compliance with the Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation (QA4EO) guidelines, this methodological work is split into two parts. Based on an original multi-disciplinary Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the GEOBIA/GEOOIA approaches, the first part of this work~promotes a shift of learning paradigm in the pre-attentive vision first stage of a remote sensing (RS) image understanding system (RS-IUS), from sub-symbolic statistical model-based (inductive) image segmentation to symbolic physical model-based (deductive) image preliminary classification capable of accomplishing image sub-symbolic segmentation and image symbolic pre-classification simultaneously. In the present second part of this work, a novel hybrid (combined deductive and inductive) RS-IUS architecture featuring a symbolic deductive pre-attentive vision first stage is proposed and discussed in terms of: (a) computational theory (system design), (b) information/knowledge representation, (c) algorithm design and (d) implementation. As proof-of-concept of symbolic physical model-based pre-attentive vision first stage, the spectral knowledge-based, operational, near real-time, multi-sensor, multi-resolution, application-independent Satellite Image Automatic Mapper™ (SIAM™) is selected from existing literature. To the best of these authors’ knowledge, this is the first time a symbolic syntactic inference system, like SIAM™, is made available to the RS community for operational use in a RS-IUS pre-attentive vision first stage, to accomplish multi-scale image segmentation and multi-granularity image pre-classification simultaneously, automatically and in near real-time.},

  abstract = {Modelling and managing topology in 3D GIS is a non-trivial task. The traditional approaches for modelling topological data in 2D GIS cannot be easily extended into higher dimensions. In fact, the topology of real 3D models is much more complex than that of the 2D and 2.5D models used in classical GIS; in consequence there is a great number of different 3D spatial models ranging from constructive solid geometry to boundary representations. The choice of a particular representation is generally driven by the requirements of a given application. Nevertheless, from a data management point of view, it would be useful to provide a general topological model handling 2D, 2.5D and 3D models in a uniform way. In this paper we describe concepts and the realisation of a general approach to modelling and managing topology in a 3D GIS based on oriented d-Generalised Maps and the closely related cell-tuple structures. As an example of the applicability of the approach, the combination of a group of buildings from a 3D city model with the corresponding part of a 2D city is presented. Finally, an outlook to ongoing research is given in the context of topological abstraction for objects represented in multi-representation databases.},

  abstract = {Estimation of grapevine vigour using mobile proximal sensors can provide an indirect method for determining grape yield and quality. Of the various indexes related to the characteristics of grapevine foliage, the leaf area index (LAI) is probably the most widely used in viticulture. To assess the feasibility of using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors for predicting the LAI, several field trials were performed using a tractor-mounted LiDAR system. This system measured the crop in a transverse direction along the rows of vines and geometric and structural parameters were computed. The parameters evaluated were the height of the vines (H), the cross-sectional area (A), the canopy volume (V) and the tree area index (TAI). This last parameter was formulated as the ratio of the crop estimated area per unit ground area, using a local Poisson distribution to approximate the laser beam transmission probability within vines. In order to compare the calculated indexes with the actual values of LAI, the scanned vines were defoliated to obtain LAI values for different row sections. Linear regression analysis showed a good correlation (R 2 = 0.81) between canopy volume and the measured values of LAI for 1 m long sections. Nevertheless, the best estimation of the LAI was given by the TAI (R 2 = 0.92) for the same length, confirming LiDAR sensors as an interesting option for foliage characterization of grapevines. However, current limitations exist related to the complexity of data process and to the need to accumulate a sufficient number of scans to adequately estimate the LAI.},

Recent proposals such as CityGML and associated gateways bridge a long-standing gap between the terrestrial models from the GIS and the CAD/CAM worlds and shift the focus from 2D to 3D. As a result, efficient and scalable techniques for storage, validation and query of 3D models will become a key to terrestrial data management. In this paper, we focus on the problem of validation of 3D geometries. First we present Oracle’s data model for storing 3D geometries (following the general OGC/ISO GML3 specifications). Then, we define more specific and refined rules for valid geometries in this model. We show that the solid representation is simpler and easier to validate than the GML model but still retains the representative power. Finally, we present explicit examples of valid and invalid geometries. This work should make it to easy to conceptualize valid and invalid 3D geometries.},

In this paper aspects on legislation related to natural hazards in Austria are summarised, with a particular focus on spatial planning activities and hazard mapping, and possible adaptations focussing on enhanced resilience are outlined. Furthermore, the system of risk transfer is discussed, highlighting the importance of creating incentives for risk-aware behaviour, above all with respect to individual precaution and insurance solutions. Therefore, the issue of creating awareness through information is essential, which is presented subsequently. The study results in recommendations of how administrative units on different federal and local levels could increase the enforcement of regulations related to the minimisation of natural hazard risk. Moreover, the nexus to risk transfer mechanisms is provided, focusing on the current compensation system in Austria and some possible adjustments in order to provide economic incentives for (private) investments in mitigation measures, i.e. local structural protection. These incentives should be supported by delivering information on hazard and risk target-oriented to any stakeholder involved. Therefore, coping strategies have to be adjusted and the interaction between prevention and precaution has to be highlighted. The paper closes with recommendations of how these efforts could be achieved, with a particular focus on the situation in the Republic of Austria.},

The SOIL MAPPER® classifier consists of a modular hierarchical data processing structure. As input, it requires a multi-spectral remote sensing image, whose spectral channels range from visible to thermal infrared wavelengths, radiometrically calibrated into top-of-atmosphere reflectance and at-satellite temperature. As output, it provides a preliminary classification map consisting of a set of kernel (i.e., reliable) semantic labels equivalent to colour-based semi-concepts. The symbolic meaning of semi-concepts is either equal or inferior (not superior) to that of concepts (object models) constituting the so-called world model (e.g., concepts equivalent to land cover classes in the USGS classification scheme). In operational terms, the degree of novelty of SOIL MAPPER® is relevant. It is fully automated, computationally efficient and easy to modify, augment, or scale to different sensors' spectral properties. Second-level application-specific processing systems (e.g., fire detection, flood detection, land cover change detection, etc.), which incorporate the “stratified” or “layered” approach, can be developed in cascade to the general-purpose SOIL MAPPER® first-stage.},

  abstract = {Dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied in the field of information visualization to generate low-dimensional, visuo-spatial displays of complex, multivariate databases—spatializations. Most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms project relatedness in data content among entities in an information space (e. g., semantic similarity) onto some form of distance among the entities, such that semantically similar documents are placed closer to one another than less similar ones. In previous studies of point-display spatializations we have shown that people indeed associate metric straight-line inter-point distances with the semantic dissimilarity of documents depicted as points in two-dimensional space. In this paper we investigate the strategies viewers employ when conflicting notions of distance (straight-line metric vs. network metric vs. topological proximity) are jointly shown in a spatialized network display of Reuters news articles depicted as points connected by links. We report empirical results of an experiment where viewers are asked to assess document similarity, depending on various distance types. We also investigate how cartographic symbolization principles (the use of visual variables, such as size, color hue, and value) influence similarity judgments. These findings provide rare empirical evidence for generally accepted design practices within the cartographic community (e. g., the effects of visual variables). In addition, empirical results from this and related studies can be used to develop design guidelines for constructing cognitively adequate spatializations for knowledge discovery in very large databases. We conclude by presenting design guidelines for network spatializations within the context of cartographic practice and theory.},

  abstract = {The geospatial sciences face grand information technology (IT) challenges in the twenty-first century: data intensity, computing intensity, concurrent access intensity and spatiotemporal intensity. These challenges require the readiness of a computing infrastructure that can: (1) better support discovery, access and utilization of data and data processing so as to relieve scientists and engineers of IT tasks and focus on scientific discoveries; (2) provide real-time IT resources to enable real-time applications, such as emergency response; (3) deal with access spikes; and (4) provide more reliable and scalable service for massive numbers of concurrent users to advance public knowledge. The emergence of cloud computing provides a potential solution with an elastic, on-demand computing platform to integrate – observation systems, parameter extracting algorithms, phenomena simulations, analytical visualization and decision support, and to provide social impact and user feedback – the essential elements of the geospatial sciences. We discuss the utilization of cloud computing to support the intensities of geospatial sciences by reporting from our investigations on how cloud computing could enable the geospatial sciences and how spatiotemporal principles, the kernel of the geospatial sciences, could be utilized to ensure the benefits of cloud computing. Four research examples are presented to analyze how to: (1) search, access and utilize geospatial data; (2) configure computing infrastructure to enable the computability of intensive simulation models; (3) disseminate and utilize research results for massive numbers of concurrent users; and (4) adopt spatiotemporal principles to support spatiotemporal intensive applications.

  abstract = {Determination of stem and crown biomass requires accurate measurements of individual tree stem, bark, branch and needles. These measurements are time-consuming especially for mature trees. Accurate field measurements can be done only in a destructive manner. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements are a viable option for measuring the reference information needed. TLS measurements provide dense point clouds in which features describing biomass can be extracted for stem form and canopy dimensions. Existing biomass models do not utilise canopy size information and therefore TLS-based estimation methods should improve the accuracy of biomass estimation. The main objective of this study was to estimate single-tree-level aboveground biomass (AGB), based on models developed using TLS data. The modelling dataset included 64 laboratory-measured trees. Models were developed for total AGB, tree stem-, living branch- and dead branch biomass. Modelling results were also compared with existing individual tree-level biomass models and showed that AGB estimation accuracies were improved, compared with those of existing models. However, current biomass models based on diameter-at-breast height (DBH), tree height and species worked rather well for stem- and total biomass. TLS-based models improved estimation accuracies, especially estimation of branch biomass. We suggest the use of stem curve and crown size geometric measurements from TLS data as a basis for allometric biomass models rather than statistical three-dimensional point metrics, since TLS statistical metrics are dependent on various scanning parameters and tree neighbourhood characteristics.},

To model spatial processes of VGI contributors, we use an invariant exponential gravity model based on article and author proximity. We define a proximity metric called a ‘signature distance’ as a weighted average distance between an article and each of its authors, and we estimate the location of 2.8 million anonymous authors through IP geolocation. Our study collects empirical data directly from 21 language-specific Wikipedia databases, spanning 7 years of contributions (2001–2008) to nearly 1 million geotagged articles. We find empirical evidence that the spatial processes of anonymous contributors fit an exponential distance decay model. Our results are consistent with the prior results on information diffusion as a spatial process, but run counter to theories that a globalized Internet neutralizes distance as a determinant of social behaviors.},

Spatial weights are a fundamental element in a wide range of spatial analysis methods that deal with testing for and estimating models with spatial autocorrelation. They form the link between the data structure in a GIS and the spatial analysis methods. Over time, the number of formats for spatial weights implemented in software has proliferated, without any standard or easy interoperability. In this paper, we propose a flexible format that provides a way to ensure interoperability within a cyberinfrastructure environment. We illustrate the format with an application of a spatial weights web service, which is part of an evolving spatial analytical workbench. We describe an approach to embed provenance in spatial weights structures and illustrate the performance of the web service by means of a number of small experiments.},

After an introduction to the basic ideas and notions of topology, a novel theory of topological spatial relations between sets is developed in which the relations are defined in terms of the intersections of the boundaries and interiors of two sets. By considering empty and non-empty as the values of the intersections, a total of sixteen topological spatial relations is described, each of which can be realized in R 2. This set is reduced to nine relations if the sets are restricted to spatial regions, a fairly broad class of subsets of a connected topological space with an application to GIS. It is shown that these relations correspond to some of the standard set theoretical and topological spatial relations between sets such as equality, disjointness and containment in the interior.},

These maps are used in stakeholder workshops and/or public discourse, but have often been highly contentious and counterproductive. We propose that quantifying and visualizing some of the uncertainty involved in making such maps could decrease their potential for causing conflict, thereby facilitating discourse and eventually, conservation action. We propose that an extra bonus could be attained by mapping the effects of missing or sparse input data regarding landowner “willingness to conserve” (given fair market compensation). The primary contributions of this action research are in the development of the propositions and in their implementation using a stochastic approach (Monte Carlo simulation). Preliminary assessment of the propositions occurred, but further research is needed to more formally evaluate them. Some practical suggestions and additional research considerations are provided.},

Although many different research areas exist within viticulture, the latest implement geospatial tools and techniques such as GIS, GPS, and remote sensing to better monitor the crop and therefore make better decisions regarding it. Geospatial techniques allow both researchers and vineyard managers to study the natural spatial variability that exists within and between vineyard blocks. This paper reviews three emerging subfields of geographic research in viticulture: site location and suitability analysis, vineyard land use identification, and precision viticulture. Future research directions and integration of additional geographic tools and techniques are also discussed.},

Data quality is a major concern, since volunteered information is asserted and carries none of the assurances that lead to trust in officially created data. During emergencies time is the essence, and the risks associated with volunteered information are often outweighed by the benefits of its use.

  abstract = {The study presents the preliminary results of two classification exercises assessing the capabilities of pre-operational (August 2015) Sentinel-2 (S2) data for mapping crop types and tree species. In the first case study, an S2 image was used to map six summer crop species in Lower Austria as well as winter crops/bare soil. Crop type maps are needed to account for crop-specific water use and for agricultural statistics. Crop type information is also useful to parametrize crop growth models for yield estimation, as well as for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables using radiative transfer models. The second case study aimed to map seven different deciduous and coniferous tree species in Germany. Detailed information about tree species distribution is important for forest management and to assess potential impacts of climate change. In our S2 data assessment, crop and tree species maps were produced at 10 m spatial resolution by combining the ten S2 spectral channels with 10 and 20 m pixel size. A supervised Random Forest classifier (RF) was deployed and trained with appropriate ground truth. In both case studies, S2 data confirmed its expected capabilities to produce reliable land cover maps. Cross-validated overall accuracies ranged between 65\% (tree species) and 76\% (crop types). The study confirmed the high value of the red-edge and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands for vegetation mapping. Also, the blue band was important in both study sites. The S2-bands in the near infrared were amongst the least important channels. The object based image analysis (OBIA) and the classical pixel-based classification achieved comparable results, mainly for the cropland. As only single date acquisitions were available for this study, the full potential of S2 data could not be assessed. In the future, the two twin S2 satellites will offer global coverage every five days and therefore permit to concurrently exploit unprecedented spectral and temporal information with high spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Accuracy assessment is an important step in the process of analyzing remote sensing data. It determines the value of the resulting data to a particular user, i.e. the information value. Remote sensing products can serve as the basis for political as well as economical decisions. Users with a variety of applications should be able to evaluate whether the accuracy of the map suits their objectives or not. In the conventional accuracy assessment an error matrix and some accuracy measures derived from it are used. An error matrix is established using some known reference data and corresponding classified data. There are various factors that affect the performance of the accuracy assessment by influencing the error matrix through out the ground truth data collection. In practice, the techniques are of little value if these effective factors are not considered. In this paper the necessity considerations for accuracy assessment including the sampling schemas and the sample size for these sampling methods are studied. Also the factors that affect selecting and applying appropriate sampling schemas and sample size are investigated. For this study numbers of synthetic images and one real image and some reference data are used. Sensitivity of the various sampling schemas has been investigated using the synthetic images and using the real image the obtained results have been confirmed. The results represent that depend on specific conditions such as type and size of the study region and object characteristics, different sampling methods and sample sizes are preferred.},

It is concluded that there is little to be gained from the complex responding and scoring schemes that have been investigated. Although some of them have confirmed potential to increase internal-consistency reliability, this outcome is often obtained only at the expense of validity. Also, the extra responding time required by some methods would permit lengthening a conventional multiple-choice test sufficiently to obtain the same reliability improvement. Partial-credit response and scoring methods that continue to be used will probably earn this status due to secondary characteristics such as providing feedback to enhance learning.},

  abstract = {The Victorian Land Use Information System (VLUIS) produces an annual land information product for the state of Victoria. It comprises three important characteristics of land information: tenure (ownership), use (property type), and cover (physical surface). The land cover component is created using a remote sensing approach. Using MODIS EVI 16-day image composites (MOD13Q1) collected over 12 months, phenology metrics such as start, end and length of the growing season are derived using the TIMESAT program. These metrics are used as input into the C5.0 program to derive a rule set to produce an annual state wide land cover classification product. A significant portion of the resources and time required to generate a land cover product is spent collecting ground data to develop the rule sets for calibration and to validate the created product. Ground data collection is undertaken once a year from October through to December. Data is collected using a stratified random sampling approach. Initially the state is stratified by Primary Production Landscapes (PPLs) which divide the state into six regions based on terrain, geomorphology, soil types, climatic conditions, and land use and management information. Using the 1:25,000 scale map grid of the state, a random selection of map grids from each PPL is taken. Within these grids, parcels that were accessible within 20 m of formed roads are selected and, from within this selection, only parcels greater than 25 ha, after imposing a 150 m internal buffer, are chosen to allow for at least one MODIS pixel (250 m x 250 m) in each parcel. This basic sampling framework has been used to collect ground data since 2009. To produce a random sample at minimal cost some map grids are resampled each year, while others are randomly added or taken out of the target sample. Some rare land cover classes, such as woody and non-woody horticulture, are not adequately sampled using this approach. A secondary sampling phase is used to target underrepresented land cover classes to ensure an adequate sample size for calibration and validation is achieved and from these supplementary data sets, a random selection is taken for validation. This paper outlines the approach taken for collecting calibration and validation ground data used to produce the VLUIS state wide land cover classification product.},

  abstract = {Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale. This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.},

  abstract = {Satellite-derived land cover maps play an important role in many applications, including monitoring of smallholder-dominated agricultural landscapes. New cloud-based computing platforms and satellite sensors offer opportunities for generating land cover maps designed to meet the spatial and temporal requirements of specific applications. Such maps can be a significant improvement compared to existing products, which tend to be coarser than 300m, are often not representative of areas with fast-paced land use change, and have a fixed set of cover classes. Here, we present two approaches for land cover classification using the Landsat archive within Google Earth Engine. Random forest classification was performed with (1) season-based composites, where median values of individual bands and vegetation indices were generated from four years for each of four seasons, and (2) metric-based composites, where different quantiles were computed for the entire four-year period. These approaches were tested for six land cover types spanning over 18,000 locations in Zambia, with ground “truth” determined by visual inspection of high-resolution imagery from Google Earth. The methods were trained on 30\% of these points and tested on the remaining 70\%, and results were also compared with existing land cover products. Overall accuracies of about 89\% were achieved for the season- and metric-based approaches for individual classes, with 93\% and 94\% accuracy for distinguishing cropland from non-cropland. For the latter task, the existing Globeland30 dataset based on Landsat had much lower accuracies (around 77\% on average), as did existing cover maps at coarser resolutions. Overall, the results support the use of either season or metric-based classification approaches. Both produce better results than those obtained from previous classifiers, which supports a general paradigm shift away from dependence on standard static products and towards custom generation of on-demand cover maps designed to fulfill the needs of each specific application.},

However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized. They remain still underutilized mainly because of their complexity, increasing volume, and the lack of efficient processing capabilities. EO Data Cubes (DC) are a new paradigm aiming to realize the full potential of EO data by lowering the barriers caused by these Big data challenges and providing access to large spatio-temporal data in an analysis ready form. Systematic and regular provision of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) will significantly reduce the burden on EO data users. Nevertheless, ARD are not commonly produced by data providers and therefore getting uniform and consistent ARD remains a challenging task. This paper presents an approach to enable rapid data access and pre-processing to generate ARD using interoperable services chains.

Sensor characteristics, illumination geometry and atmospheric conditions affect the signal received by a multispectral satellite sensor. In this paper an empirical line method is used to calibrate an eight band multispectral WorldView-2 image. Correction for illumination geometry and atmospheric attenuation in the imagery was achieved by developing a non-linear relationship between top of atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance and surface reflectance values measured from field targets, using an (ASD Inc) FieldSpecPro spectrometer. An accuracy assessment was undertaken by comparing image reflectance values against the surface reflectance values of 17 field targets. The overall accuracy based on the RMSE for the eight bands ranged between 0.69 – 2.35 \% with the greatest variance in the near infrared bands. The results of this study show that empirical line methods can be used to successfully calibrate WorldView-2 satellite imagery to reflectance data. Key Words: atmospheric correction, empirical line method, WorldView-2.},

  abstract = {The Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) aims to realise the full potential of Earth observation data holdings by addressing the Big Data challenges of volume, velocity, and variety that otherwise limit the usefulness of Earth observation data. There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI). A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This open-source approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Very high resolution (VHR) satellite data is experiencing rapid annual growth, producing petabytes of remotely sensed data per year. The WorldView constellation, operated by DigitalGlobe, images over 1.2billionkm2 annually at $<$2m spatial resolution. Due to computation, data cost, and methodological concerns, VHR satellite data has mainly been used to produce needed geospatial information for site-specific phenomena. This project produced a VHR spatiotemporally explicit wall-to-wall cropland area map for the rainfed residential cropland mosaic of the Tigray Region, Ethiopia, which is comprised mostly of smallholder farms. Moderate resolution satellite data do not have adequate spatial resolution to capture the total area occupied by smallholder farms, i.e., farms with agricultural fields of ≤45×45m in dimension. In order to accurately map smallholder cropped area over a large region, hundreds of VHR images spanning two or more years are needed. Sub-meter WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 segmentation results were combined with median phenology amplitude from Landsat 8 data to map cropped area. Over 2700 VHR WorldView-1, -2 data were obtained from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) via the NextView license agreement and were processed from raw imagery to produce a smallholder crop map in \textasciitilde{}1week using a semi-automated method with the large computing capacity of the Advanced Data Analytics Platform. We estimated cropped area in Tigray to be 46\% with a commission error of 5\%±10\% and omission error of 15\%±12\%. This methodology is extensible to other regions with similar vegetation texture and can easily be expanded to run on much larger regions.},

  abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in monitoring food security is to provide reliable crop yield information that is temporally consistent and spatially scalable. An ideal yield dataset would not only extend globally and across multiple years, but would also have enough spatial granularity to characterize productivity at the field and subfield level. Rapid increases in satellite data acquisition and platforms such as Google Earth Engine that can efficiently access and process vast archives of new and historical data offer an opportunity to map yields globally, but require efficient and robust algorithms to combine various data streams into yield estimates. We recently introduced a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that combines crop models simulations with imagery and weather data to generate 30m resolution yield estimates without the need for ground calibration. In this study, we tested new large-scale implementations of SCYM, focusing on three regions with varying crops, field sizes and landscape heterogeneity: maize in the U.S. corn belt (390,000km2), maize in Southern Zambia (86,000km2), and wheat in northern India (450,000km2). As a benchmark, we also tested a simpler empirical approach (PEAKVI) that relates yield to the peak value of a time series of spatially aggregated vegetation indices, similar to methods used in current operational monitoring. Both SCYM and PEAKVI were applied to data from all Landsat's sensors and MODIS for more than a decade in each region, and evaluated against ground-based estimates at the finest available administrative level (e.g., counties in the U.S.). We found consistently high correlations (R2≥0.5) between the spatial pattern of ground- and satellite-based estimates in both U.S. maize and India wheat, with small differences between methods and source of satellite data. In the U.S., SCYM outperformed PEAKVI in tracking temporal yield variations, likely owing to its explicit consideration of weather. In India, both methods failed to track temporal yield changes, with various possible explanations discussed. In Zambia, the PEAKVI approach applied to MODIS tracked yield variations much better (R2$>$0.5) than any other yield estimate, likely because the frequent cloud cover in this region confounds the other approaches. Overall, this study demonstrates successful approaches to yield estimation in each region, and illustrates the importance of distinguishing between accuracy for spatial and temporal variation. The 30m resolution of Landsat-based SCYM does not appear to offer large benefits for tracking aggregate yields, but enables finer scale analyses than possible with the other approaches.},

  abstract = {Satellite-derived land cover maps play an important role in many applications, including monitoring of smallholder-dominated agricultural landscapes. New cloud-based computing platforms and satellite sensors offer opportunities for generating land cover maps designed to meet the spatial and temporal requirements of specific applications. Such maps can be a significant improvement compared to existing products, which tend to be coarser than 300m, are often not representative of areas with fast-paced land use change, and have a fixed set of cover classes. Here, we present two approaches for land cover classification using the Landsat archive within Google Earth Engine. Random forest classification was performed with (1) season-based composites, where median values of individual bands and vegetation indices were generated from four years for each of four seasons, and (2) metric-based composites, where different quantiles were computed for the entire four-year period. These approaches were tested for six land cover types spanning over 18,000 locations in Zambia, with ground “truth” determined by visual inspection of high-resolution imagery from Google Earth. The methods were trained on 30\% of these points and tested on the remaining 70\%, and results were also compared with existing land cover products. Overall accuracies of about 89\% were achieved for the season- and metric-based approaches for individual classes, with 93\% and 94\% accuracy for distinguishing cropland from non-cropland. For the latter task, the existing Globeland30 dataset based on Landsat had much lower accuracies (around 77\% on average), as did existing cover maps at coarser resolutions. Overall, the results support the use of either season or metric-based classification approaches. Both produce better results than those obtained from previous classifiers, which supports a general paradigm shift away from dependence on standard static products and towards custom generation of on-demand cover maps designed to fulfill the needs of each specific application.},

  abstract = {The OGC® Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay. The standard also defines how a client can request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates publishing of geospatial processes and client discovery of processes and and binding to those processes into workflows. Data required by a WPS can be delivered across a network or they can be available at a server. 

 PyWPS was one of the first implementations of OGC WPS on the server side. It is written in the Python programming language and it tries to connect to all existing tools for geospatial data analysis, available on the Python platform. During the last two years, the PyWPS development team has written a new version (called PyWPS-4) completely from scratch. 

 The analysis of large raster datasets poses several technical issues in implementing the WPS standard. The data format has to be defined and validated on the server side and binary data have to be encoded using some numeric representation. Pulling raster data from remote servers introduces security risks, in addition, running several processes in parallel has to be possible, so that system resources are used efficiently while preserving security. Here we discuss these topics and illustrate some of the solutions adopted within the PyWPS implementation.},

  abstract = {Storage management of multidimensional arrays aims at supporting the array model needed by applications and insuring fast execution of access operations. Current approaches to store multidimensional arrays rely on partitioning data into chunks (equally sized subarrays). Regular partitioning however, does not adapt to access patterns, leading to suboptimal access performance. We propose a storage approach for multidimensional discrete data (MDD) based on multidimensional arbitrary tiling. Tiling is arbitrary in that any partitioning into disjoint multidimensional intervals as well as incomplete coverage of n-D space and gradual growth of MDDs are supported. The proposed approach allows the storage structure to be configured according to user access patterns through tunable tiling strategies. We describe four strategies and respective tiling algorithms and present performance measurements which show their effectiveness in reducing disk access and post-processing times for range queries},

As part of this, a project was undertaken to map the extent of surface water across Australia using the multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery. A water detection algorithm was used based on a decision tree classifier, and a comparison methodology using a logistic regression. This approach provided an understanding of the confidence in the water observations. The results were used to map the presence of surface water across the entire continent from every observation of 27years of satellite imagery. The Water Observation from Space (WOfS) product provides insight into the behaviour of surface water across Australia through time, demonstrating where water is persistent, such as in reservoirs, and where it is ephemeral, such as on floodplains during a flood. In addition the WOfS product is useful for studies of wetland extent, aquatic species behaviour, hydrological models, land surface process modelling and groundwater recharge. This paper describes the WOfS methodology and shows how similar time-series analyses of nationally significant environmental variables might be conducted at the continental scale.},

It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1°×0.1° grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2\%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5\%, Tropical savannah).

  abstract = {To date, the automatic or semiautomatic transformation of huge amounts of multisource multiresolution spaceborne imagery into information still remains far below reasonable expectations. The original contribution of this paper to existing knowledge on the development of operational automatic remote sensing image understanding systems (RS-IUSs) is fourfold. First, existing RS-IUS architectures are critically revised. In this review section, the two-stage stratified hierarchical RS-IUS model, originally proposed by Shackelford and Davis, is identified as a subclass of the parent class of multiagent hybrid systems for RS image understanding, which is potentially superior to the two-stage segment-based RS-IUS architecture that is currently considered the state-of-the-art in commercial RS image-processing software toolboxes. Second, this paper highlights the degree of novelty of an operational automatic near-real-time well-posed model-driven application-independent per-pixel Landsat-like spectral-rule-based decision-tree classifier (LSRC) recently presented in RS literature. Third, five original downscaled implementations of the LSRC system are proposed to be input with a multispectral image whose spectral resolution overlaps with, but is inferior to, Landsat's. These five downscaled LSRC implementations are identified as the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre-like SRC, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-like SRC, the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer-like SRC, the IKONOS-like SRC, and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation-like SRC, respectively. LSRC, together with its five downscaled implementations, called the integrated SRC system of systems, is eligible for use as the automatic pixel-based preliminary classification first stage of a two-stage stratified hierarchical RS-IUS instantiation. Fourth, to sustain the feasibility of the new downscaled LSRC implementations, a novel vegetation spectral index is introduced and discussed. In Part II of- this paper, experimental results are presented and discussed for the entire SRC family of classifiers.},

At best, the system provides a bridge towards an external library using user-defined functions, explicit import/export facilities or linked-in Java/C\# interpreters. Time has come to rectify this with SciQL1, a SQL query language for scientific applications with arrays as first class citizens. It provides a seamless symbiosis of array-, set-, and sequence- interpretation using a clear separation of the mathematical object from its underlying implementation. A key innovation is to extend value-based grouping in SQL:2003 with structural grouping, i.e., fixed-sized and unbounded groups based on explicit relationships between their dimension attributes. It leads to a generalization of window-based query processing with wide applicability in science domains.

Estimates of affected people that match with the official figures including registered refugees and IDPs were obtained with this method.
The approach has a potential in estimating in an objective and timely way the impacts of humanitarian crisis.
Prospective studies can make use of the temporal and spatial advantages of open-access geospatial data (night-time satellite imagery and GHSL derived products) in the field of disaster risk management to investigate the role of social dynamics over space and time in the occurrences of disasters and provide evidence-based knowledge to support disaster risk reduction plans and actions.},

  abstract = {Landsat occupies a unique position in the constellation of civilian earth observation satellites, with a long and rich scientific and applications heritage. With nearly 40years of continuous observation – since launch of the first satellite in 1972 – the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century.},

Identifying and understanding the key drivers of change in the data economy and EO sector (including technological, human, cultural and legal factors) is essential to providing context on which to build an EO strategy for the twenty-first century. The emergence of cloud computing is already transforming the way we access and exploit data.

  abstract = {Nowadays, research practice in all scientific disciplines is increasingly, and in many cases exclusively, data driven. Knowledge of how to use tools to manipulate research data, and the availability of e-Infrastructures to support them for data storage, processing, analysis and preservation, is fundamental. In parallel, new types of communities are forming around interests in digital tools, computing facilities and data repositories. By making infrastructure services, community engagement and training inseparable, existing communities can be empowered by new ways of doing research, and new communities can be created around tools and data. Europe is ideally positioned to become a world leader as provider of research data for the benefit of research communities and the wider economy and society. Europe would benefit from an integrated infrastructure where data and computing services for big data can be easily shared and reused. This is particularly challenging in EO given the volumes and variety of the data that make scalable access difficult, if not impossible, to individual researchers and small groups (i.e. to the so-called long tail of science). To overcome this limitation, as part of the European Commission Digital Single Market strategy, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative was launched in April 2016, with the final aim to realise the European Research Area (ERA) and raise research to the next level. It promotes not only scientific excellence and data reuse, but also job growth and increased competitiveness in Europe, and results in Europe-wide cost efficiencies in scientific infrastructure through the promotion of interoperability on an unprecedented scale. This chapter analyses existing barriers to achieve this aim and proposes the Open Science Commons as the fundamental principles to create an EOSC able to offer an integrated infrastructure for the depositing, sharing and reuse of big data, including Earth Observation (EO) data, leveraging and enhancing the current e-Infrastructure landscape, through standardization, interoperability, policy and governance. Finally, it is shown how an EOSC built on e-Infrastructures can improve the discovery, retrieval and processing capabilities of EO data, offering virtualised access to geographically distributed data and the computing necessary to manipulate and manage large volumes. Well-established e-Infrastructure services could provide a set of reusable components to accelerate the development of exploitation platforms for satellite data solving common problems, such as user authentication and authorisation, monitoring or accounting.},

  abstract = {For society to benefit fully from its investment in Earth Observation, the data must be accessible and familiar to a global community of users who have the skills, knowledge and understanding to use the observations appropriately in their work. Future ‘Environmental Data Scientists’ will need to draw on multiple data and information sources, using data analysis, statistics and models to create knowledge that is communicated effectively to decision-makers in government, industry, and civil society. Networks, cloud computing and visualization will become increasingly important as citizen scientists, data journalists and politicians increasingly use Earth observation products to give their arguments and decisions scientific credibility.The overarching aim of Earth Observation education must therefore be to support life-long learning, allowing users at all levels to remain up-to-date with EO technologies and communication mechanisms that are relevant to their individual needs. Current and emerging methodologies for interactive education (such as “MOOCs” and mobile learning), and hands-on engagement with real data (such as through citizen science projects) will be central to outreach, training and formal education in this field. To achieve this, it will be important to engage a wider community of experts from a range of disciplines, and to establish a comprehensive network of educators, technical experts, and content producers. It will also be important to encourage “crowd-sourcing” of new contributions, to help maintain scientific and educational quality. A case study from the World Bank’s Open Learning Campus illustrates the opportunities to influence thinking much beyond the environmental data scientist community.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has found many applications in remote sensing. These applications range from retrieval algorithms to bias correction, from code acceleration to detection of disease in crops, from classification of pelagic habitats to rock type classification. As a broad subfield of artificial intelligence, machine learning is concerned with algorithms and techniques that allow computers to “learn” by example. The major focus of machine learning is to extract information from data automatically by computational and statistical methods. Over the last decade there has been considerable progress in developing a machine learning methodology for a variety of Earth Science applications involving trace gases, retrievals, aerosol products, land surface products, vegetation indices, and most recently, ocean applications. In this chapter, we will review some examples of how machine learning has already been useful for remote sensing and some likely future applications.},

  abstract = {Citizen Science, or the participation of non-professional scientists in a scientific project, has a long history—in many ways, the modern scientific revolution is thanks to the effort of citizen scientists. Like science itself, citizen science is influenced by technological and societal advances, such as the rapid increase in levels of education during the latter part of the twentieth century, or the very recent growth of the bidirectional social web (Web 2.0), cloud services and smartphones. These transitions have ushered in, over the past decade, a rapid growth in the involvement of many millions of people in data collection and analysis of information as part of scientific projects. This chapter provides an overview of the field of citizen science and its contribution to the observation of the Earth, often not through remote sensing but a much closer relationship with the local environment. The chapter suggests that, together with remote Earth Observations, citizen science can play a critical role in understanding and addressing local and global challenges.},

In the Big Data era, the opportunities are many but so are the challenges at the different levels. In this chapter, we situate the Big Data discussion in the context of the scientific method in a world of contested politics, in which science can no longer be seen as “neutral”. We argue for a more open and participative science. Science reproducibility is not just about experiment repeatability but also about the transparency of the process leading to a shared outcome. Opening up science will need a major paradigm shift, including also an underpinning information infrastructure geared towards sharing data, information and knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. The Global Earth Observation System of System (GEOSS) was used as a case study. As we show, there is an increasing gap between the rapidity of technological progress and the slow pace of the organisational and cultural change needed to address interoperability, reproducibility and legitimacy challenges effectively.},

Obviously, goal is to allow users to “ask any question, any time, on any size”, thereby enabling them to “build their own product on the go”.One of the most influential initiatives in Big EO Data is EarthServer which has demonstrated new directions for flexible, scalable EO services based on innovative NoSQL technology. Researchers from Europe, the USA and Australia have teamed up to rigorously materialize the datacube concept. EarthServer has established client and server technology for such spatio-temporal datacubes. The underlying scalable array engine, rasdaman, enables direct interaction, including 3D visualization, what-if scenarios, common EO data processing, and general analytics. Services exclusively rely on the open OGC “Big Earth Data” standards suite, Web Coverage Service (WCS). Phase 1 of EarthServer has advanced scalable array database technology into 100+ TB services; in Phase 2, Petabyte datacubes are being built for ad-hoc extraction, processing, and fusion. But EarthServer has not only used, but also shaped the Big Datacube standards in OGC, ISO and INSPIRE.We present the current state of EarthServer in terms of services and technology and outline its impact on the international standards landscape.},

On one side, there is an emerging trend of visualizing data and their changes in space and time through multidimensional geospatial clients and/or virtual globes. In the most advanced cases, these are not simply plain viewers but also allow analysis of the data by acting as “multidimensional intelligent geo-viewers”. On the other side, citizen science is providing a great momentum to the possibility of lay people taking part in scientific development. It is a new, citizen-centred paradigm which, in most cases, takes advantage of the individual and collective augmented capability of sensing the surrounding world through the sensors that we wear. The “citizen sensors” will consciously contribute to this development, either through volunteered geographic information or by being themselves an unconscious part of the data analytics, which makes use of geo-crowdsourced data to extract information in order to create a higher level understanding of natural and manmade phenomena. This chapter seeks to outline the Web technological solutions for visualizing and analyzing such data, through a summary of the current state of the art and the original applications developed by the authors.},

The CI platform utilizes a wide variety of computing such as GPGPU, distributed, real-time and cluster computing, which are being brought together architecturally to enable data-driven analysis, scientific understanding of earth system models, and research collaboration. This development addresses the need for close integration of EO and other geospatial information in the face of growing volumes of the data, and facilitates spatio-temporal analysis of disparate and dynamic data streams. Horizontal scalability and linear throughput are supported in the heart of the platform itself. It is being used to support very broad application areas, ranging from high-resolution settlement mapping, national bioenergy infrastructure to urban information and mobility systems. The platform provides spatio-temporal decision support capabilities in planning, policy and operational missions for US federal agencies. Also, the platform is designed to be functionally and technologically sustainable for continued support of the US energy and environment mission for the coming decades.},

  abstract = {EO based services and related products have been proven to be a stable source of information with reliable quality under varying soil and weather conditions. Information products, like the TalkingFields maps, allow the farmer to more accurately react with site-specific farming techniques. More accuracy means lower production costs, as resources such as water, seeds and fertilizer are not wasted. More accurate also means more efficient in the sense of yield per fertilizer or water used. Last but not least, more accurate also means more sustainable because less fertilizer is leached to the ground water. This benefits on the one side farmers with increased economic profits. On the other side, it also serves natural resource providers such as drinking water suppliers or environmental protection agencies, resulting in both successful commercial business and as well as environmental gains. All in all, smart farming supports ecologically and economically sound agricultural management via site-specific applications – an important step towards sustainable agriculture. Sentinel-2 already marks a huge step towards better spectral coverage and operational availability of satellite data. The free and open access to Sentinel-2 data and infrastructure platforms like FS-TEP will guarantee that these data can be used by everybody around the Globe, no matter whether they are from an industrialized country or a developing country. This gives equal chances to everybody to be more sustainable in agriculture.},

Many use innovative machine- and deep-learning techniques to understand factors key to development. Leading satellite-based initiatives include: Monitoring Electrification from Space: Through analyzing 2 decades of satellite images for nightly light output from India’s 600,000 villages, this project developed a novel data-intensive strategy to improve the monitoring of rural electricity provision. The data is accessible via an online visualization platform to help optimize electrification planning. Mapping Poverty by Satellite: To generate inexpensive, timely poverty estimates, this project examined how well satellite indicators contribute to poverty prediction, and how this depends on the type of prediction model. When compared with Sri Lankan census data, high-resolution satellite indicators track poverty very well, with potential to improve traditional poverty maps. Satellite-Based Yield Measurement: Through trials in Uganda, this project is testing a pioneering approach which relates satellite-based data to plot-level ground measures of yields. This enables future yield predictions, which can inform better policymaking to help farmers improve productivity. Putting big data innovation into everyday practice requires collaboration between data scientists, technologists and sector specialists.

As a proof of concept, an innovative EO semantic querying (EO-SQ) subsystem was designed and prototypically implemented in series with an EO image understanding (EO-IU) subsystem. The EO-IU subsystem is automatically generating ESA Level 2 products (scene classification map, up to basic land cover units) from optical satellite data. The EO-SQ subsystem comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) and an array database embedded in a client server model. In the array database, all EO images are stored as a space-time data cube together with their Level 2 products generated by the EO-IU subsystem. The GUI allows users to (a) develop a conceptual world model based on a graphically supported query pipeline as a combination of spatial and temporal operators and/or standard algorithms and (b) create, save and share within the client-server architecture complex semantic queries/decision rules, suitable for SCBIR and/or spatiotemporal EO image analytics, consistent with the conceptual world model.},

  abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10m to 60m depending on the spectral band with a 290km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications.},

But to date, there has been no global and methodologically consistent quantification of changes in surface water over time. Jean-Franois Pekel and colleagues have analysed more than three million Landsat images to quantify month-to-month changes in surface water at a resolution of 30 metres and over a 32-year period. They find that surface waters have declined by almost 90,000 square kilometreslargely in the Middle East and Central Asiabut that surface waters equivalent to about twice that area have been created elsewhere. Drought, reservoir creation and water extraction appear to have driven most of the changes in surface water over the past decades.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Remote-sensing data has the potential to revolutionize social science. One of the most prominent examples of this is the Nighttime Lights data set, which provides digital measures of night-time luminosity from 1992 to 2013. This study evaluates the Nighttime Lights data against detailed rural electrification data from the 2011 Census of India. The results suggest that many night-time luminosity measures derived from satellite data are surprisingly accurate for measuring rural electrification, even at the village level and using simple statistical tools. We also demonstrate that this accuracy can be substantially improved by using of better GIS maps, basic geoprocessing tools, and particular aggregations of night-time luminosity. Night-time luminosity performs worse in measuring financial inclusion or proxies of poverty, however, and detects rural electrification less accurately when the supply of power is intermittent. These results offer guidelines for when and how remote-sensing data can be used when administrative data is absent or unreliable.},
