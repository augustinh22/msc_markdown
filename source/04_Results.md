# Maps and Charts

- display and describe

- include all 4 maps (index of persistence, total clean, total valid, number of invalid)

\autoref{fig:water_old} demonstrates a similar method applied to the semantic data cube implemented here, but using water-like semi-concepts from SIAM™ instead of the Australian water detection algorithm (i.e. Water Observation from Space). Here, pixels masked as no-data as well as cloud-like and unclassified semi-concepts have been excluded from analysis such that only pixels deemed clear observations are included and considered valid. It shows the normalised percentage of water semi-concept pixels related to other valid semi-concepts (e.g. vegetation-like) from January 31, 2016 to January 31, 2018, which is from a total of 103 observations along the dimension of time.

![Normalised water detection based on water semi-concepts in Syria near the border of Turkey, excluding no-data, cloud like and unclassified pixels from January 31, 2016 until January 31, 2018 (103 time observations). Method similar to Mueller et al. (2016). \label{fig:water_old}](source/figures/water_edit.png)
