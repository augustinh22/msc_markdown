# Data

- trend of free and open-access data
- set-backs due to proprietary algorithms in "open" data
- ARD
- better spatial resolutions and more frequent observations

- incorporation of additional cloud masks, such as Fmask [@zhuObjectbasedCloudCloud2012], as long as they work well with Sentinel-2 data, which lacks thermal bands.

- incorporation of other sensors, such as Landsat

It would be fantastic to have automated workflows that provide a generic data cube containing all existing and up-to-date data ready for the analysis of defined indicators, but not limited to that purpose.


*The years have also seen the birth of constellation with tens of micro EO satellites able to capture images of the Earth at an unprecedented pace. One image per day and maybe more is no more a chimera like it was in the early 2000 years. Constellation like Planet and Terra Bella/SkyBox (now merged Planetto Acquire Terra Bella from Google, Sign Multi-Year Data Contract, <https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-to-acquire-terra-bella-from-google/>)offers HR and VHR data commonly with a business model based on subscription which is exactly focused on monitoring purposes. As shown before in (Adam Van Etter, 2016), there are several efforts in order to exploit data coming from traditional VHR missions like DigitalGlobe ones and new space missions like Planet in order to extract automatically objects.*

- intercalibration of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data for longer-term dynamics

# Reproducible EO-analysis

transferability

repeatability

- spurious correlation in big earth data analysis -- archive characteristics, etc.

# Data Cubes

# Semantics

# Indicators

- big Earth data and SDGs

# Privacy and monitoring

- at least something about spatial resolution, temporal frequency and public vs. private sector
- what is privacy in terms of regular global EO data collection?
- maybe reference other kinds of big spatial data (e.g. Strava)


## Livelihood-related Crisis Indicators

- how can livelihood be addressed from an indicator perspective…
- some non-\ac{EO} livelihood security indicators (existing or envisioned in literature)
- existing or envisioned \ac{EO}-based livelihood indicators or sources of evidence
- lack of definition for crisis -- links to emergency management in a changing climate or more immediate changes/impacts

\ac{EO} data is not only useful for monitoring longer-term international goals, but also for generating spatially-explicit evidence for assessing the impact of events producing rapid change, such as flooding, deforestation, wildfires, damage to irrigation infrastructure in the dry season, etc.

Free and open \ac{EO} data are a reliable and objective global data source that can also serve humanitarian organisations and initiatives in moments of emergency or crisis, however defined. A handful of research with the purpose of developing what are known as *crisis indicators* exists, utilising \ac{EO}-based information. The term "crisis" is, however, very loosely defined and quite subjective, since the definition is related to what is being affected and who or what it impacts. Connecting detectible changes in land cover or land use as being caused or related to a defined crisis requires a lot of inference, and various additional data sources for validation, which may not be available at the time of analysis due to limitations and restrictions to data collection, access, etc. associated with the identified crisis.

Livelihood-specific Evidence

1. economic size, growth and distribution (using luminosity)
2. population size, growth and distribution
3. differences in geographic endowments (water, farmland, natural resources, etc.) -- affect on supply of public goods
4. size and growth of cities, their legal and illegal parts, slums, distribution of infrastructure and economic activity, etc.
5. density and quality of road networks
6. size, quality and change of land plots
7. weather, climate, droughts, crop failures, food shortages, etc. potential disasters
8. infrastructure that could prevent natural disasters
9. forced displacement, razed villages, mass graves
10. humanitarian responses to disasters and conflicts
11. illegal crops (e.g. drugs)
12. reconstruction activity after conflict (e.g. build up of infrastructure)

Land degradation -- Long-term multi-temporal vegetation analyses (large scale analysis using Sentinel-2 data,
Loss of agricultural areas -- Long-term multi-temporal vegetation analyses (Hot spot analysis using Sentinel-2 data
Flood impact -- Long term probability of flooding impact on agriculture areas, accessibility
Power shortage -- Night-time light detection.


- crop cycles (measure periods of seasonal stress -- low harvest)
- contribute spatially explicit information to existing vulnerability/risk/hazard assessment methods
