# Data

- trend of free and open-access data
- set-backs due to proprietary algorithms in "open" data
- ARD
- better spatial resolutions and more frequent observations


*The years have also seen the birth of constellation with tens of micro EO satellites able to capture images of the Earth at an unprecedented pace. One image per day and maybe more is no more a chimera like it was in the early 2000 years. Constellation like Planet and Terra Bella/SkyBox (now merged Planetto Acquire Terra Bella from Google, Sign Multi-Year Data Contract, <https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-to-acquire-terra-bella-from-google/>)offers HR and VHR data commonly with a business model based on subscription which is exactly focused on monitoring purposes. As shown before in (Adam Van Etter, 2016), there are several efforts in order to exploit data coming from traditional VHR missions like DigitalGlobe ones and new space missions like Planet in order to extract automatically objects.*

- intercalibration of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data for longer-term dynamics

# Reproducible EO-analysis

transferability

repeatability

- spurious correlation in big earth data analysis -- archive characteristics, etc.

# Data Cubes

# Semantics

# Indicators

- big Earth data and SDGs

# Privacy and monitoring

- at least something about spatial resolution, temporal frequency and public vs. private sector
- what is privacy in terms of regular global EO data collection?
- maybe reference other kinds of big spatial data (e.g. Strava)
