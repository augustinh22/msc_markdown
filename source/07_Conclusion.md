\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}


Extracting information from \ac{EO}-time-series is a challenging task due to the volume, velocity and variety of \ac{EO} images. The largest benefit of the semantic data cube implemented here is that it fully automates data acquisition, a certain level of semantic enrichment and access to data ready for analysis. The generic, application-independent semantic enrichment utilised enables queries and \ac{EO}-based indicator extraction for many thematic tasks. Since the information layers (i.e. basis for semantic queries and analysis) continue to exist in the data cube and are stable concepts, given solid documentation on methods applied to data cube output, reproducible results and repeatable analysis ought to be possible. This could be particularly relevant for supporting global initiatives with information based on data collected independent of political borders and in a constant, unbiased way. Just because the data can be considered unbiased does not mean that information generated from it are unbiased, or that they will be used and understood in ways that are not misleading.

The contribution and innovation presented in this thesis is the automated set-up of a semantic data cube. This contrasts to most other existing implementations because it stores information and data together in an analysis-ready way, allowing ad-hoc multi-temporal, spatial and semantic queries and supporting reproducible results. However, it is not only the technical implementation, rather also an initial exploration of some of the challenges faced when working with dense time-series of \ac{EO} data over larger spatial areas. These challenges are posed by qualities characteristic of big Earth data, more broadly, such as their volume, velocity, and variety.

Developing methods to extract reliable indicators from big \ac{EO} sources is one way to leverage the potential these data have to offer. The ad-hoc queries that can be conducted using this implementation can hopefully offer meaningful information to support international initiatives. They can hopefully produce information about visible land cover changes through or utilising time instead of controlling for it. Exploratory outputs exemplarily showing dynamics of surface water and vegetation based on water- and vegetation-like pixels, based on semi-concepts, are presented and situated in the scope of the \acp{SDG}. Further research will include developing more reliable indicators tested for agreement with existing sources, as well as exploring methods and metrics to better assess the distribution, variation, variability and uncertainty inherent in multi-temporal \ac{EO} analysis and archives.
